Quickstart

0. You need nodejs installed, which also gives you the npm command.
1. Run `npm install` to get the required packages of angular (for the code that runs on the browser, aka client-side) and express (makes it easier to write a server-side web app in node).
2. Run `node app.js` to start the server.
3. load up http://localhost:8000/index.html in your browser and look at the node server's logs to see the "geocoding" happen and store.
4. Reload the page, and observe that the location is pulled for the second one without doing any new geocoding.
